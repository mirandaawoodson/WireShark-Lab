# Wireshark Lab

## 📌 Overview
This lab is based on the **Wireshark Masterclass (YouTube)** and demonstrates the fundamentals of capturing and analyzing network traffic. It provides hands-on experience with packet capture, filtering, and traffic analysis using Wireshark.

## 🧪 Lab Objectives
In this lab, we practiced:
- Capturing live packets with **dumpcap**  
- Filtering network traffic with display and capture filters  
- Using **name resolution** to identify hostnames  
- Customizing and interpreting the **time column**  
- Analyzing packet captures with **Wireshark statistics**  
- **Extracting files** from captured traffic  
- Mapping IP address locations with **GeoIP**  


## 📊 Key Takeaways
- Learned how to **capture, filter, and analyze packets** effectively.  
- Gained experience with **Wireshark’s statistics tools** to interpret traffic patterns.  
- Practiced **forensic techniques** like file extraction and GeoIP mapping.  
- Improved skills in **reading and interpreting PCAP files** for security analysis.  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
